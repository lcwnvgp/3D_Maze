This project is a 3D maze puzzle game where players control a rolling ball to navigate through a visually rich and interactive maze environment. Built using pure C++ and Vulkan, the game features:

  Real-time ray tracing for accurate lighting and reflections
  
  A custom-built physics engine for realistic ball movement
  
  Interactive elements such as bounce pads, wind zones, and mirror puzzles
  
  Maze and sphere models created with Blender
  
  Puzzle mechanics that combine physics with logic and spatial reasoning

The game aims to blend technical graphics programming with creative gameplay design.
